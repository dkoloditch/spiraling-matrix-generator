# spiraling-matrix-generator

Just a little project for fun.

In a nutshell, this program is based on direction. As long as the population
direction is accurate, the values will be populated accordingly.

As an example, numbers 0 through 80 should produce an output like this:
```
72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80
71 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49
70 41 20 21 22 23 24 25 50
69 40 19 6  7  8  9  26 51
68 39 18 5  0  1  10 27 52
67 38 17 4  3  2  11 28 53
66 37 16 15 14 13 12 29 54
65 36 35 34 33 32 31 30 55
64 63 62 61 60 59 58 57 56
```
